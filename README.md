### Air Quality Monitoring

Tech Challenge - Proximity Labs

## Introduction

This is a simple and working implementation of the challenge requirements. This implementation includes a navbar to show the title of the project, a sidebar to show live AQI of all the cities, and a big beautiful graph for live tracking of selected city's AQI.

## Features Implemented

-   Live City-wise AQI table
-   AQI upto 2 decimal places
-   AQI highlighted with different colors based on severity
-   Magnified graph of live AQI of selected city

## Features To Be Implemented

-   Functionality to provide comparison of AQI of different cities

## Libraries Used

-   Bootstrap: For styling and layout purposes
-   Lodash: To use generic logics directly, instead of writing repetitive code
-   Recharts: To draw a simple and beautiful graph

> Note: The above libraries were used for one of the following two reasons:
> -   To avoid reinventing the wheel
> -   To find the simplest solution under time constraint

## Total Effort

-   Implementation: 8-10 hours
-   Deployment and Documentation: 1-2 hours
